The source code I used these 3 weeks to get familiar with deep reinforcement learning.To train the model, use the command ./run_gpu breakout

To run the modified model, use the command ./run_gpu breakout -netfile "convnet_atari3_new"

To show the training process, use the command python show_result.py
